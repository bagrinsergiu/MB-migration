# MB-Migration Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the MB-Migration project. Tasks are organized by category and priority.

## Architecture Improvements

### Code Organization and Structure
1. [x] Refactor the Bridge class to reduce its size and responsibilities (Single Responsibility Principle)
2. [x] Implement proper dependency injection throughout the application instead of direct instantiation
3. [x] Create interfaces for all major components to improve testability and maintainability
4. [ ] Standardize error handling across the application with a consistent approach
5. [ ] Implement a proper service layer between controllers and data access
6. [ ] Reorganize namespaces to better reflect the domain and technical concerns

### Database Access
7. [ ] Create a database abstraction layer that supports multiple database types
8. [ ] Implement prepared statements for all database queries to prevent SQL injection
9. [ ] Add connection pooling for database connections to improve performance
10. [ ] Create repository classes for each entity to encapsulate data access logic
11. [ ] Implement database migrations for schema changes

### API and Integration
12. [ ] Document all API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger
13. [ ] Implement API versioning to support backward compatibility
14. [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
15. [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization for all endpoints
16. [ ] Create integration tests for external service interactions

## Code Quality Improvements

### Testing
17. [ ] Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
18. [ ] Implement integration tests for critical paths
19. [ ] Add end-to-end tests for main user flows
20. [ ] Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
21. [ ] Implement mutation testing to ensure test quality

### Code Style and Standards
22. [ ] Apply PSR-12 coding standards across the codebase
23. [ ] Implement static code analysis tools (PHPStan, Psalm)
24. [ ] Add code style checking to CI pipeline
25. [ ] Remove commented-out code and debug statements
26. [ ] Add proper PHPDoc comments to all classes and methods

### Performance and Optimization
27. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
28. [ ] Optimize database queries by adding proper indexes
29. [ ] Implement lazy loading for resource-intensive operations
30. [ ] Add performance monitoring and profiling
31. [ ] Optimize file uploads and S3 interactions

## Security Improvements

32. [ ] Implement proper input validation for all user inputs
33. [ ] Add CSRF protection for all forms
34. [ ] Implement proper session management
35. [ ] Secure sensitive configuration data using environment variables
36. [ ] Implement proper logging for security events
37. [ ] Conduct a security audit and address findings

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

38. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
39. [ ] Document the database schema and relationships
40. [ ] Create a developer onboarding guide
