# MB-Migration Project Requirements

## Project Overview
MB-Migration is a tool designed to migrate projects from Ministry Brands to Brizy. The application provides an API for initiating and managing the migration process, with capabilities for full project migration or selective page migration.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Migration Functionality
1. Migrate complete projects from Ministry Brands to Brizy
2. Support selective migration of individual pages
3. Preserve the structure of pages (parent-child relationships)
4. Migrate design elements including layouts, sections, and components
5. Transfer and convert fonts and typography settings
6. Process and migrate media assets (images, videos, etc.)
7. Handle URL structures and internal linking

### Project Management
1. Map Ministry Brands projects to Brizy projects
2. Track migration status and progress
3. Support pausing and resuming migrations
4. Provide error recovery for failed migrations
5. Allow rollback of failed migrations
6. Support partial migrations
7. Generate migration reports and logs

### API Capabilities
1. Expose RESTful endpoints for migration operations
2. Support health checks for monitoring system status
3. Provide mapping management endpoints
4. Enable workspace clearing and management
5. Support project cloning operations
6. Implement proper authentication and authorization
7. Include rate limiting for API endpoints

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. Handle large projects efficiently
2. Optimize database queries with proper indexing
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. Support lazy loading for resource-intensive operations
5. Process media assets efficiently (resize, format conversion)
6. Provide acceptable response times for API endpoints

### Scalability
1. Support multiple concurrent migrations
2. Handle increasing numbers of projects and users
3. Scale horizontally to accommodate growing workloads
4. Implement connection pooling for database connections

### Reliability
1. Ensure data integrity during migration
2. Implement proper error handling and recovery
3. Provide detailed logging for troubleshooting
4. Support automated backups of critical data
5. Implement health checks for all services
6. Set up alerting for critical errors

### Security
1. Implement proper input validation for all user inputs
2. Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization
3. Protect against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, etc.)
4. Use prepared statements for database queries to prevent SQL injection
5. Secure sensitive configuration data using environment variables
6. Implement proper session management
7. Log security events for auditing

### Maintainability
1. Follow PSR-12 coding standards
2. Implement proper dependency injection
3. Create interfaces for major components
4. Organize code with clear separation of concerns
5. Document code with PHPDoc comments
6. Remove hardcoded values and use configuration
7. Refactor large classes to follow Single Responsibility Principle

### Testability
1. Achieve high unit test coverage (at least 80%)
2. Implement integration tests for critical paths
3. Add end-to-end tests for main user flows
4. Set up continuous integration for automated testing
5. Support mutation testing to ensure test quality

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
1. Implement proper service layers between controllers and data access
2. Create a database abstraction layer supporting multiple database types
3. Use repository pattern for data access
4. Implement proper dependency injection throughout the application
5. Follow SOLID principles in code design

### Infrastructure
1. Support containerization with Docker
2. Enable automated deployments
3. Implement infrastructure as code
4. Support multiple environments (development, production)
5. Provide monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Documentation
1. Document API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger
2. Document database schema and relationships
3. Create developer onboarding guide
4. Document deployment process
5. Provide user documentation for the migration process

### Development Process
1. Implement automated dependency updates
2. Set up code style checking in CI pipeline
3. Use static code analysis tools
4. Implement database migrations for schema changes
5. Support automated deployments
