# Core Development Principles

- Reuse existing code.
- Search the codebase before writing new code.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions.
- Choose the simplest solution that respects layers and module boundaries.
- Keep changes minimal, safe, and focused.
- Do not rewrite working code without explicit reason.
- Modify existing code instead of duplicating it.
- Use MCP tools first.
